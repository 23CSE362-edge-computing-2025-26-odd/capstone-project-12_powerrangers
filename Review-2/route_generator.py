"""

This script generates vehicle routes for a road network
represented as a graph of nodes (Aâ€“I) and edges.

Main Features:
1. Defines nodes, edges, and boundary nodes of the network.
2. Recursively computes all possible routes up to a given depth
   while avoiding cycles, and stores valid boundary-to-boundary paths.
3. Specifies multiple vehicle types (fast car, slow car, ambulance)
   with different speed and acceleration parameters.
4. Creates route definitions for normal vehicles as well as
   special hardcoded ambulance parking routes.
5. Exports all routes into a SUMO-compatible XML file
   (`vehicles.rou.xml`) with proper formatting.
